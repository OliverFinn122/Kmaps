This project was built into a previous project that was created to map dog walking clients by date and time. The project can optimize any number of k centers to a choice of 8 different client arrays, one for each day of the week, and one for all combined days. It can also optimize k centers based on client mobility. It is to be run through Jupyter Notebooks.
